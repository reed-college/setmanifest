# setmanifest
A python script to assist with changing the munki ClientIdentifier, aka manifest.

Josh wrote this as a way to learn python.  He used meinzerj's setmanifest.command ruby script as a general guide.

This is not currently in production.  We have Jason's ruby version deployed to all clients.
